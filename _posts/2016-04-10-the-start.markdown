I don't like writing, but I am going to start blogging - mainly due to two reasons: to express my thoughts and to improve my writing.

Oftentimes I have too many random thoughts and ideas hovering in my mind, so maybe writing about them would formulate my thinking, allowing me to understand myself even more. In fact, I used to blog in elementary school and freshman year of college. Reading my old posts with the restropective mindset is a wonderful experience, and I am hoping to create that feeling once again.

The second reason is to improve my writing skill. Writing has always been my greatest weakness. Hopefully blogging will help.

Just like the preface of every great story, I hope this is a good start to an exciting journey ahead.
