title: About
---

I am currently a software engineer at [Blend](https://blend.com/), working on making our systems reliable and scalable. I enjoy thinking about and building products that change the way we live. I graduated from UCLA in 2017 with a double major in Computer Science and Physics.

Back in college, I was the president of [UCLA ACM](http://acm.cs.ucla.edu), one of the largest student run tech orgs in Los Angeles, and devoted most of my time to building a better CS community. I founded and organized several large scale tech events such as [Founder's School](http://uclafs.com) and Hacker Expo. I also did software engineering internships at [Twitter](https://twitter.com), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com), and [WhatsApp](http://whatsapp.com), applied deep learning on keystroke dynamics research at [UCLA Internet Research Initiative](http://www.iri.ucla.edu), and was a campus ambassador at [Sequoia Capital](https://www.sequoiacap.com). 

I am interested in startups and venture capitals in both the U.S. and China. The best way to reach me is via Twitter ([@vicoyeh](https://twitter.com/vicoyeh)) - let's chat.
