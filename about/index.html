        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
        	I'm a third-year undergrad studying Computer Science and Physics at UCLA. I am interested in various subjects of Computer Science, especially web development and machine learning.

        	 During my spare time I enjoy hacking on personal <a href="/projects">projects</a> and watching/playing basketball. As the Hack Chair of <a href="http://acm.cs.ucla.edu/">UCLA ACM</a>, I moderate <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1638313646457724/">hack@ucla</a>, organize bi-weekly Hack Nights, and am currently planning <a href="http://uclafs.com">Founder's School</a>.
