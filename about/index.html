        <p>
        	Hey, this is Vic. I am currently a software engineer at <a href="https://blend.com">Blend</a>, building the future of lending. I write <a href="http://www.nanoreview.xyz">Nano Review</a>, a microblog my friends and I started to share interesting academic papers. I recently graduated from UCLA with a double major in Computer Science and Physics.

       		<br/>
            Even though I am not in academia anymore, I still keep an eye on the research trends by reading textbooks and papers occasionally. My primary academic interests include machine learning, distributed systems, and software engineering.
            <br/>
            <br/>
        	Back in college, I was the president of <a href="http://acm.cs.ucla.edu">UCLA ACM</a>, one of the largest student run tech orgs in Los Angeles, and devoted most of my time to building a better CS community. I also did software engineering internships at <a href="https://twitter.com">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a>, and <a href="http://whatsapp.com">WhatsApp</a>, and was a campus ambassador at <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com">Sequoia Capital</a>.
