My name is Vic Yeh. I am a software engineer at [Blend](https://blend.com/), working on platform and infrastructure. I am also an angel investor and work with founders at [Polymath](https://polymathcp.com), where we help portfolio startups achieve product-market fit.

My interests lie in the intersection of technology and venture capitals in both the U.S. and China. In technical terms, the areas I am passionate about include distributed systems, machine intelligence, consumer internet, and enterprise SaaS. The best way to reach me is via Twitter: [@vicoyeh](https://twitter.com/vicoyeh).
