I am currently a software engineer at [Blend](https://blend.com/), working on platform and infrastructure. I enjoy thinking about and building products that change the way we live. I also work with founders at [Polymath](https://polymathcp.com), where we help portfolio startups achieve product-market fit.

I am interested in startups and venture capitals in both the U.S. and China. The best way to reach me is via Twitter ([@vicoyeh](https://twitter.com/vicoyeh)) - let's chat.
