        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
        	I'm a fourth year undergrad studying Computer Science and Physics at UCLA. I'm passionate about building products for solving techinally interesting problems.
        	<br/>
       		<br/>
        	I consider myself a social entrepreneur. While at UCLA I was the president of <a href="http://acm.cs.ucla.edu">UCLA ACM</a>, one of the largest student run tech orgs in Los Angeles, and devoted most of my time to building a better CS community. 
        	<br/>
       		<br/>
        	I'll be joining <a href="https://blend.com">Blend</a> as a software engineer after graduation. In the past few summers, I wrote code at <a href="https://twitter.com">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a>, and <a href="http://whatsapp.com">WhatsApp</a>.
